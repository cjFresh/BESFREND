<h1>B.E.S.F.R.E.N.D.</h1>
<h4>Brgy. Evacuation System For Risky Emergencies & Natural Disasters</h4>

<p>This is a capstone project developed by four (4) BS ICT students of the University of San Carlos, namely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Carl Haiden R. Fuentes</li>
    <li>Scott Leigh C. Lariosa</li>
    <li>Clem Joshua C. Rama</li>
    <li>Kristian Romeo</li>
</ul>

<h4>About the Project</h4>
<p>
The project is conceived out of the idea that the Philippines is a disaster-prone country, yet there is little to no research on how to improve evacuation management with the use of information technology. We developed B.E.S.F.R.E.N.D. in order to improve existing systems that are related to disaster risk management, or set the wheels in motion for further research and development. 

We donated this project to the Departmenf of Computer and Information Sciences of the University of San Carlos as part of our Community Extension Service, with high hopes that a version 2 will be developed.

<h4>Technical Details</h4>
